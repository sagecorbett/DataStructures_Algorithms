Linked Lists - Length & Count

Implement Length() to count the number of nodes in a linked list.

length(null) => 0
length(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null) => 3
Implement Count() to count the occurrences of an integer in a linked list.

count(null, 1) => 0
count(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, 1) => 1
count(1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> null, 2) => 4

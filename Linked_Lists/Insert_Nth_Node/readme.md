# Linked Lists - Insert Nth

## Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/55cacc3039607536c6000081/

Implement an InsertNth() function (insert_nth() in PHP) which can insert a new node at any index within a list.

InsertNth() is a more general version of the Push() function that we implemented in the first kata listed below. Given a list, an index 'n' in the range 0..length, and a data element, add a new node to the list so that it has the given index. InsertNth() should return the head of the list.

insertNth(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, 0, 7) === 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null)
insertNth(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, 1, 7) === 1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> null)
insertNth(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, 3, 7) === 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> null)
